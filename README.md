# 2D-PWEM-Python
This is the program created to analyze dispersion properties of 2D photonic crystals of arbitrary shaped unit cell. It's V0.5 because a perfectionist would add new code + additional symetries in the pwem_params and device classes. Hopefully you enjoy it because you are not acquired to have any licence for Python IDEs, well, except a few I suppose.
